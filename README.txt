*** BREWERY FINDER v1.0***

INTRODUCTION & GENERAL NAVIGATION
=================================

The Brewery Finder application runs in all modern browsers and on PCs, tablets and smartphones. It contains a map of Seattle, WA and it's surrounding suburbs. The application pings Foursquare to provide the location and basic information for breweries within 10000 meters of the city center. 

Each location is denoted by a marker on the map, and clicking on a marker will open an info windwo providing additional details about the brewery, including: name, address, website (if applicable), and number of Foursquare check-ins.

The number of breweries found is indicated in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Next to the brewery count is a menu button, which when clicked, will open a list of all breweries. Typing a name of a brewery in the input filed at the top of the list will filter the list to those matching the users' input. Also, clicking on any brewery name in the list will open it's info window and pan the map to it's location. Clicking the menu button again will close the list view.

To ren the Brewery Finder application, download all files to the same directory, maintaining the existing file/folder structure. Open index.html in your web browser. An internet connections is required as data from Google and Foursquare will need to downloaded in order for the application to operate as intended.
